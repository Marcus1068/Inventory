# Inventory App

Inventory management app for dealing with all personal belongings and gettings photos, invoices and other info about persons, 
rooms etc in your household.

User can manage rooms, persons living in household, item categories, brands etc.

Exporting data in csv files is possible and re importing afterwards as well.

Reporting module Provider users with a PDF file with sorting and filter options to view their belongings.

The ultimate goal of this app is to let users print out a report in case they need to call their insurance after some incident happened so they have a list of all personal items, ordered by room, or category.

The first version only supports german and english language due to time limits of myself. The app runs as a universal app on iPhone and iPad. It does not use any 3rd party library or framework and does not include any kind of tracking mechanism for gathering user data.

The reason for developing this app has been personal interest in Swift as language and the lack of inventory apps that fit my personal needs.
